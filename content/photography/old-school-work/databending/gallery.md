title: "Databending"
description: "\"Databending (or data bending) is the process of manipulating a media file of a certain format, using software designed to edit files of another format. Distortions in the medium typically occur as a result, and the process either falls under a broader category of, or is frequently employed in glitch art.\"

As part of my Photography A level I took these images on B&W 135 film, developed and digitised them, then edited them as if they were audio files using Audacity.
<br><br>
The images are of the dishes at <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RAF_Stenigot'>RAF Stenigot</a>, three of which have since been scraped. The images were exhibited at <a href='https://www.galleryatstmartins.com/'>Gallery at St.Martin's</a>.
