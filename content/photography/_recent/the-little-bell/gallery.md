title: "The Little Bell"
description: "The little bell lies on the ground<br>
Although it tries it cannot sound<br>
It used to ring across the air<br>
Its sweetened tone would linger there<br>
<br>
But from a careless hand it rocked<br>
Its shell is only made of crock<br>
Although it lies there split in two<br>
It still tries to ring out to you<br>
